- This is a html and css practice template to create minimalist webpafe using flexbox alignment and easy transition effects.
- Breaking the html down into **hero, body_1, body_2, body_3 and end_section**. Each with proper flexbox usage.
- The style isn't perfect there are still room of improvements.
- Will add Javascript later.
